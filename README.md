## 1. Description
This a beginner machine learning project that uses decision trees to decide if a bank should or not grant a loan to a costumer.

## 2. Tools
This project was completely made in Python(**Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn**), Jupyter Notebook(anaconda) and Git/Github.

## 3. Introduction to the problem
The interest earned on loans is a crucial revenue source for banks, making loan prediction vital. Accurate predictions offer several advantages:
1. Risk Management: Banks can assess each loan's risk level, minimizing defaults and losses.
2. Profitability: Optimizing lending practices ensures healthy profit margins by offering favorable terms to low-risk borrowers.
3. Compliance: Predicting loan status helps banks comply with regulations by assessing borrower creditworthiness.
4. Customer Satisfaction: Timely loan decisions improve customer service, fostering loyalty.
5. Portfolio Management: Identifying problem loans early allows for proactive risk mitigation.
6. Competitive Advantage: Effective loan prediction enhances a bank's reputation and market position, attracting more customers and minimizing exposure to risky borrowers.
